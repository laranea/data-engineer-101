Prefect is an open source workflow management system. The creators of Prefect wanted to build a new workflow management system that tackles the shortcomings of Apache Airflow. You can read more about how it compares to Airflow [here](https://medium.com/the-prefect-blog/why-not-airflow-4cfa423299c4). The product itself is actually called Prefect Core while the company behind it is called Prefect. They also offer a cloud solution called Prefect Cloud.
